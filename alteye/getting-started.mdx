## Get familiar

AltEye is built around a simple flow: check the dashboard, open a server, then take action.

## Do this first

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a server">
    Connect your first Rust server. See [Adding a server](/alteye/adding-server).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set filters and kick message">
    Open [Protection settings](/alteye/server-settings/protection) and configure your default kick message and filters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review core pages">
    Open [Kicks](/alteye/managing-kicks) and [Whitelist](/alteye/whitelist-management) to see how player actions are tracked.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigation basics

- **Dashboard**: Home view for status and totals.
- **Kicks**: Remove players and review history.
- **Whitelist**: Approve access and set expirations.
- **Settings**: Account and server settings.

<Tip>
If you are unsure where something lives, open the [Navigation & Page Map](/alteye/navigation).
